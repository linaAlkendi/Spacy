    <h2>Size and Atmosphere:</h2>
    <p class = "PS">Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is similar in size to Earth, with a diameter only slightly smaller.
      Its thick atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid droplets that completely obscure its surface from view.</p>
  

  
    <h2>Extreme Surface Conditions:</h2>
    <p class = "PS">Venus has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead, due to the greenhouse effect caused by its dense atmosphere.
      The pressure at the surface is about 92 times that of Earth's atmosphere, making it inhospitable to life as we know it.</p>
 

 
    <h2>Rotation and Orbit:</h2>
    <p class = "PS">Venus rotates very slowly on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, but it has a much shorter year, orbiting the Sun every 225 Earth days.
      Its rotation is also retrograde, meaning it rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets in the solar system.
