    <h2>Unique Characteristics:</h2>
    <p class = "PS">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is distinguished by its unusual sideways rotation, with its axis of rotation tilted almost perpendicular to its orbit. This sideways tilt gives Uranus extreme seasonal variations, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.</p>
 


    <h2>Composition and Atmosphere:</h2>
    <p class= "PS">Uranus is an ice giant, similar in composition to Neptune, consisting mainly of hydrogen, helium, and water ice. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane that give it a blue-green color.</p>
 


    <h2>Moons and Rings:</h2>
    <p class = "PS">Uranus has 27 known moons, with the five largest being Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. It also has a faint ring system, which was discovered in 1977 by astronomers using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory.</p>
