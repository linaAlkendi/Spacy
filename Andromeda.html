    <h1>Andromeda Galaxy</h1>
    <ul id="Galaxy-list">
      <li>Overview
        <p> The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31 or M31, is a majestic spiral galaxy located in the constellation Andromeda. It is the closest spiral galaxy to our Milky Way and is a prominent member of the Local Group, a collection of galaxies that includes the Milky Way, Triangulum Galaxy, and numerous smaller galaxies. Andromeda is situated approximately 2.537 million light-years away from Earth, making it the largest galaxy in our cosmic neighborhood. It boasts a diameter of about 220,000 light-years, nearly twice that of the Milky Way, and contains a vast array of stars, gas, and dust. </p>

      <li>Structure and Composition
        <p> Embark on an exploration of the Andromeda Galaxy, revealing its captivating spiral structure with a luminous central bulge and vibrant spiral arms. Discover the central features, from a supermassive black hole to a diverse stellar population, shaping Andromeda's rich astronomical tapestry. Join us in uncovering the cosmic wonders within this neighboring spiral galaxy. </p>

          <li>Structure of the Andromeda Galaxy
        <p> The Andromeda Galaxy's captivating spiral structure showcases a bright central bulge enveloped by spiral arms teeming with young, hot stars, interstellar gas, and dust. This intricate pattern results from the gravitational interactions and rotational dynamics within the galaxy, offering a stunning visual spectacle. The central bulge hosts a population of older, redder stars that have endured for billions of years, while the spiral arms house a younger, bluer stellar population, creating a dynamic balance within Andromeda's cosmic canvas. </p> 
          </li>
          <li>Central Features and Stellar Composition
            <p>At the heart of the Andromeda Galaxy lies a supermassive black hole, boasting a mass equivalent to approximately 140 million times that of the Sun. This gravitational behemoth plays a pivotal role in shaping the galaxy's structure and dynamics. The galaxy's diverse stellar composition ranges from mature, red stars dominating its central regions to youthful, blue stars adorning the spiral arms. Additionally, Andromeda's composition includes molecular clouds, acting as crucibles for the birth of new stars, and ionized gas regions that emanate vibrant colors when observed in various wavelengths. The interplay of these central features defines Andromeda's rich astronomical tapestry.  </p>

      <li>Future Collision with the Milky Way
        <p> A fascinating aspect of the Andromeda Galaxy's future involves its inevitable collision with our own Milky Way. Scientists predict that in about 4 billion years, the two galaxies will merge to form a new, larger galaxy often referred to as "Milkomeda" or "Milkdromeda." Despite the colossal scale of this cosmic event, individual stars within the galaxies are unlikely to collide due to the vast distances between them. Instead, their gravitational interactions will cause a complex dance, reshaping the structure of both galaxies. This collision offers a glimpse into the dynamic and evolving nature of our universe, providing astronomers with valuable insights into the fate of galaxies over cosmic timescales. </p>
