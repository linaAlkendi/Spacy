    <h2>Size and Composition:</h2>
    <ul class="planetUl">
      <li>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the solar system, with a diameter about nine times that of Earth.</li>
      <li>It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with a small rocky core at its center.</li>
    </ul>


 
    <h2>Iconic Rings:</h2>
    <p class = "PS">Saturn is famous for its spectacular ring system, which consists of thousands of individual ringlets made mostly of ice and rock particles. These rings are believed to be the remnants of a shattered moon or moons, or perhaps material left over from the planet's formation.</p>
  


    <h2>Moons:</h2>
    <p class = "PS">Saturn has at least 82 known moons, with the largest being Titan. Titan is notable for its thick atmosphere and methane lakes, making it one of the most Earth-like bodies in the solar system.</p>
